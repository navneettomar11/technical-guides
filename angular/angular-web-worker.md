# Angular Web Worker
Web Worker is really a worker, working its ass off because of the heavy load it is given. In computing context, Web worker is a background thread that is created alongside/parallel the main thread where heavy computations are done to prevent drag on the main thread.

Web worker is one of the many workers we have in web. There are
- Service workers
- Shared workers
- Web workers
- Inline workers
- Dedicated workers

All do the same thing, creating a background thread but run different functions. So the similar thing they do is create a parallel thread.
