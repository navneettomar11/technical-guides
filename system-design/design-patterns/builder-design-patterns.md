# Intent
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex object step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

- Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
- Parse a complex representation, create one of several targets.
