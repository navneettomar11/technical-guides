# Intent
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex object step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

# Problem
Image a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step intialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried a monstrous constructor with lot of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code.
