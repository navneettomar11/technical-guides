# What is Pastebin ?
Pastebin is a service that allows users to paste text-based data or images over the internet and generate a unique short URL for a user  to access the uploaded data. The user can also share the short URL so that anyone can view the content.

The user who creatdd it can also update or modify the data if he/she is logged in (or has an API key if the request is made using REST API).
