# Introduction to GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for your API, and server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type. For example, a GraphQL service that tells us who the logged  in user is (me) as well as the user'name name might look something like this:
```javascript
type Query {
    me: User
}
type User {
    id: ID,
    name: String
}
```
Along with functions for each field on each type:
```javascript
function Query_me(request) {
    return request.auth.user;
}

function User_name(user) {
    return user.getName();
}
```
Once a GraphQL service is running (typically at a URL on a web service), it can be sent GraphQL queries to validate and execute. A received query is first checked to ensure it only refers to the types and fields defined, then runs the provided functions to produce a result.
For example the query:
```javascript
{
    me {
        name
    }
}
```
Could produce the JSON result:
```javascript
{
    "me" :{
        "name" : "Luke Skywalker"
    }
}
