# What is Data Analytics?
Data by itself is just an information source. But unless you can understand it, you will not be able to use it effectively.

Data or information is in raw format. The increase in size of the data has lead to a rise in need for carry out inspection, data cleaning, transformation as well as data modeling to gain insights from the data in order to derive conclusions for better decision making process. This process is known as **data analysis**.

Data Mining is a popular type of data analysis technique to carry out data modeling as well as knowledge discovery that is geared towards predictive purposes. Business Intelligence operations provide various data analysis capabilities that rely on data aggregation as well as focus on the domain expertise of business. In Statistical applications, business analytics can be divided into **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Confirmatory Data Analysis(CDA)**.

EDA focuses on discovering new features in the data and CDA focuses on confirming or falsifying existing hypotheses. Predective Analytics does forecasting or classification by focusing on statistical or structural models while in text analytics, statistical linguistic and structural technique are applied to extract and classify information from textual soruces, a species of unstructured data. All these are varieties of data analysis.

The revolutionising data  wave has brought improvements to the overall functionalities in many different ways. There are various emerging requirements for applying advanced analytical techniques to the Big Data spectrum. Now experts can make more accurate and profitable decisions.

## Data Analysis vs Data Reporting
The analysis is an interactive process of a person tackling a problem, finding the data required to get an answer, analyzing that data, and interpreting the result in order to provide a recommendation for action.

A business intelligence environment, otherwise known as a reporting environment also includes calling as well as reporting execution. So, outputs are then printed in the desired form. Reporting refers to the process of organizing and summarizing in an easily readable format to communicat the important information. Reports help organizations in monitoring different areas of performance and improving customer sartisfication. One can also consider the conversion of raw data into useful information as a part of reporting, whereas, the same can be thought for analysis which transforms the information into keys usable insights.

# Data Analysis Process
Data Analytics is a combination of process to extract information from datasets.

1. **Business Understanding** - Whenever any requirement occurs, firstly we need to determine the business objective, assess the situation, determine data mining goals and then produce the project plan as per the requirment. Business objective are defined in this phase.

2. **Data Exploration** - For the further process, we need to gather initial data, describe and explore data and last verify data quality to ensure it contains the data we require. Data collected from the various sources is described in terms of its application and the need for the project in this phase. This is also known as data exploration. This is necessary to verify the quality of data collected.

3. **Data Prepartion** - From the data collectd in the last step, we need to select data as per the need, clean it, construct it to get useful information and then it all. Finally, we need to format the data to get appropriate data. Data is selected cleaned, and integrated into the format finalized for the analysis in this phase.

4. **Data Modeling** - After gathering the data, we perform data modeling on it. For this we need to select a modeling technique, generate, test design, build a model and asses the model built. The data model is build to analyze relationship between various selected objects in the data. Test cases are built for assessing the model and model is tested and implemented on the data in this phase.

5. **Data Evaluation** - Here, we evaluate the result from the last step, review the scope of error, and determine the next steps to perform. We evalutate the result of the test cases and review the scope of errors in this phase.

6. **Deployment** - We need to plan the deployment, monitoring and maintainance and produce a final report and review the project. In this phase, we deploy the result of the analysis. This is also known as reviewing the project.


# Types of Data Analysis
There are four types of techniques used for Data Analysis:

1. **Descriptive Analysis** - With the help of descriptive analysis, we analyze and describe the features of a data. It deals with the summarization of information. Descriptive analysis, when coupled with visual analysis provides us with a comprehensive structure of data.

    In the descriptive analysis, we deal with the past data to draw conclusions and present our data in the form of dashboards. In business, descriptive analysis is used for determining the Key performance indicator or KPI to evaluate the performance of the business.

2. **Predictive Analysis** - With the help of predective analysis, we determine the future outcome. Based on the analysis of the historical data, we are able to forecast the future. It makes use of descriptive analysis to generate predictions about the future. With the help of technological advancements and machine learning, we are able to obtain predective insights about the future.
    Predictive analytics is a complex field that require a large amount of data, skilled implementation of predictive models and its tuning to obtain accurate predictions. This requires a skilled workforce that is well versed in machine learning to develop effective models.

3. **Diagnostic Analysis** -  At time, businesses are requird to think critically about the nature of data and understand the descriptive analysis in depth. In order to find issues in the data, we need to find anomalous(uneven, inconsistent, incompatible, contradictory) patterns that might contribute towards the poor performance of our model.
    With diagnostic analysis you are able to diagnose various problems that are exhibited through your data. Businesses use this technique to reduce their losses and optimize their performances. Some of the examples where businesses use dignostic analysis are:
    - Business implement diagnostic analysis to reduce latency in logistics and optimize their production process.
    - With the help of diagnostic analysis in the sales domain, once can update the marketing strategies which would otherwise attenuate(minimize, brought down, cut down, deflate) the total revenue

4. **Prescriptive Analysis** - Prescriptive analysis combines insights from all of the above analytical techniques. It is referred to as the final frontier of data analytics. Prescriptive analytics allows companies to make decisions based on them. It makes heavy usage of Artifical Intelligence in order to faciliate companies into making careful business decisions.

    Major industrial players like Facebook. Netflix, Amazon and Google are using prescriptive analytics to make key business decisions. Furthermore, financial institutions are gradually leveraging the power of this technique to increase their revenue.
