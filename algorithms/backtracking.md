# Backtracking Algorithm
Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solution that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.


The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a good state if you didn't it isn't
