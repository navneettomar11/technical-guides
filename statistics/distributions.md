# Methods of Assigning Probabilities
The three general methods of assigning probabilities are :
1. the classical method
2. the relative frequency of occurence method
3. subjective probabilities

## Classical Method of Assigning Probabilities
When probabilities are assigned based on laws and rules, the method is referred to as the **classical method of assigning probabilities**. This method involves an experiment, which is a process tht produces outcomes, and an event, which is an outcome of an experiment.

When we assign probabilities using the classical method, the probability of an individual event occuring is determined as the ration of the number of items in the population containing the event (n<sub>e</sub>) to the total number of items in the population(N). That is, P(E) = n<sub>e</sub>/N. For example, if a company has 20 workers and 70 are female, the probability of randomly selecting a female from this company is 70/200 = .35.

> n<sub>e</sub> = the number of outcomes in which the event occurs out of N outcomes.


# Distributions
From a pratical perspective, we can think of a distribution as a function that describes the relationship between observations in a sample space.

For example, we may be interested in the age of humans, with individual ages representing observations in the domain, and ages 0 to 125 the extend of the sample space. The distribution is a mathematical function that describes the relationship of observations of different heights.

> _A distribution is a simply a collection of data, or scores on a variable. Usually, these scores are arranged in order from smallest to larges and then they can be presented graphically_.

Many data conform to well-known and well-understand mathematical functions, such as the Gaussian distribution. A function can fit the data with a modification of the parameters of the function, such as the mean and standard deviation in the case of the Gausisian.

Once a distribution function is known, it can be used as a shortand for describing and calculating related quantities, such as likehoods of observation, and plotting the relationship.

When we use the term normal distribution in statistics, we usually mean a probablity distribution. Good examples are the Normal distribution, the Binomial distribution and the Uniform distribution.

Alright. Let's start with a definition!
A distribution in statistics is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.


## Density Functions

Distributions are often described in terms of their density or density functions.

Density functions are functions that describe how the proportion of data or likelihood of the porportion of observations change over the range of the distribution.

Two types of density functions are probability density functions and cumulative density functions.
- **Probability Density function**: calculates the probability of observing a given value.
- **Cumulative Density functiin**: calculates the probability of an observation equal or less than a value.

A probability density function or PDF, can be used to calculate the likelihood of a given observation in a distribution. It can also be used to summarize the likelihood of observations across the distribution sample space. Plots of the PDF show the familiar shape of a distribution, such as the bell-curve for the Gaussian distribution.
