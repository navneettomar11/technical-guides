# Measure of Variability
Variability means 'Scatter' or 'Spread'. Thus measures of variability refer to the scatter or spread of scores around their central tendency. The measures of variability how the distribution scatter above and below the central tender.

Suppose, there are two groups. In one group there are 50 boys and in another group 50 girls. A test is administeredg to both these groups. The mean score of boys and girls is 54.4 and we compare the mean score of both the groups, we find that there is no difference in the performance of the two group. But suppose the boy's scores are found to range from 20 to 80 and the girl's scores range from 40 to 60.

This difference in range show that the boys are more variable, because they cover more territory than the girls. If the group contains individuals of widely differing capacities, scores will be scattered from high to low, the range will be relatively wide and variability become large.

### The scatter or variability of the observations of a distribution about some measure of central tendency.

## Need of Variability
1. **Helps to as-certain the measures of deviation:** The measures of variability help us to measure the degree of deviation, which exist in the data. By that can determine the limits within which the data will navy in some measurable variety or quality.
2. **It helps to compare different group:** With the help of measure of validity we can compare the original data expressed in different units.
3. It is useful to supplement the information provided by the measures of central tendency.
4. It is useful to calculate further advance statistics based on the measure of dipersion.

There are four measures of variability:
1. The Range
2. The Quartile Deviation
3. The Average Deviation
4. The standard deviation

## The Range (R)
Range is the difference between in a series. It is the most general measure of spread or scatter. It is a measure of variability of the varities or observation among themseleves and does not given an idea about the spread of the observations around some central value.
Range = H - L
Here H = Highest score
L = Lowest Score

**Example**

**In a class, 20 students have secured the marks as following:**

22, 48, 43, 60, 55, 25, 15, 45, 35, 68, 50, 70, 35, 40, 42, 48, 53, 44, 55, 52

Here - The highest score is 70

The lowest score is 15

Range = H - L = 70 - 15 = 55

If the range is higher than the group indicates more heterogeneity(विविधता) and if the ranger is lower than the group indicates more homegeneity(एकरूपता). Thus range provides us an instant and rough indication of the variability of a ditribution.

## The Quartile Deviation (Q):
Next to range quartile deviation is another measure of variability. It is based upon the interval containing the middle fifty percent of cases in a given distribution. One quarter means 1/4th of something, when a scale is divided into to four equal parts. **"The quartile deviation or Q is the one-half the scale distance between 75th and 25th percentiles in a frequency distribution."**

## The Variance and the Standard Deviation
The other two measures of variability that we will consider are more elaborate and also depend on whether the data set is just a sample drawn from a much larger population or is the whole population.

The **sample variance** of a set of n sample data is the number s<sup>2</sup> defined by the formula
> s<sup>2</sup>  = (Σ(x-x')<sup>2</sup>)/(n-1)

The variance is defined as:
> The average of the squared differences from the Mean

The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out number are.
Its symbol is σ (the greek letter sigma).
The formula is easy: it is the square root of the **Variance**.

To calculate the variance follows these steps
- Work out the Mean (the simple average of the numbers)
- Then for each number: substract the Mean and square the result(the squared difference).
- The workout the averabe of those squared differences.

### Example
You and your friends have just measured the heights of your dogs(in millimeters):

![Height of Dogs](images/statistics-dogs-graph.gif)

The height (at the shoulders) are : 600mm, 470mm, 170mm, 430mm and 300mm

Find out the Mean, the Variance, and the Standard Deviation.

Your first step is to find the Mean:

Mean = (600 + 470 + 170 + 430 + 300)/5 = 1970/5 = 394

so the mean(average) height is 394mm. Let's plot this on the chart:

![Statistics Dog Mean](images/statistics-dogs-mean-2.gif)

Now we can calulate each dog's difference from the Mean:

![Statistics Dog Deviation](images/statistics-dogs-deviation.gif)

To calculate the Variance, take each difference, square it, and then average the result:
Variance
σ<sup>2</sup> = (206<sup>2</sup> + 76<sup>2</sup> + (-224)<sup>2</sup> + 36<sup>2</sup> + (-94)<sup>2</sup>)/5 = (42436 + 5776 + 50176 + 1296 + 8836)/5	 = 1085205/5 = 21704

So the Variance is **21704**
And the Standard Deviation is just the square root of Variance, so: 
Standard Deviation 
σ = sqrt(21704) = 147.32 = 147 (to the nearest mm)

And the good thing about the Standard Deviation is that it is useful. Now we can show which heights are with one Standard Deviation (147mm) of the mean.

So, using the Standard Deviation we have a "standard" way of knowing what is normal, and what is extra large or extra small.
