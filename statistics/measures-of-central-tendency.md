# Measures of Central Tendency

## What is Central Tendency ?
Central tendency (sometimes called 'measures of location', 'central loation' or just 'center') is a way to describe what typical for a set of data. Central tendency doesn't tell you specifies about the individual pieces of data, but it does give you an overall picture of what is going on in the entire data set. There are three major ways to show central tendency: mean, median and mode.

## Mean
The mean is the average of a set numbers. Add up all the numbers in a set of data and then divide by the number of items in the set. For example, the mean of 2, 3, 5, 9, 11 is:
(2+3+5+9+11)/5 = 30/5 = 6

> Mean = (x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn)/n  

## Median
The median is the middle of a set of numbers. Think of it like the median in a road (that grassy area in the middle that separates traffic). Place your data in order, and the number in the exact center of a list is the median. For example: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
The median is 4 because it's in the center, with three number either side.

## Mode
The mode is the most common number in a set of data. For example, the mode of 1,2,2,3,5,6 is 2. Some data sets have no mode, like 1,2,3,4,5,6. Others have multiple modes lile this one: 1,1,2,3,3.

## Outliers
Outliers are extremely high or extremly low values. Outliers can affect central tendency, especially the mean. For example, if you got paid three weeks in a row but took vacation in the fourth week, your paychecks might be: $300, $300, $300, $0. Your four week mean would be ($300+$300+$300+0)/4 = $225. That outlier of zero dollars brought your mean down very low.

## Normal Distribution
Data can be distributed (spread out) in different ways:

But there are many cases where the data tends to be around a central value with no bias left or right, and it gets close to a normal distribution.

The "Bell Curve" is a Normal distribution. And the yellow histogram shows some data that is follows it closely, but not prefectly( which is usual).

We say the data is "normally distributed"?  
The normal distribution has:
mean = median = mode

symmetry about the center. 50% of values less than the mean and 50% greater than the mean.

## What is Skew Distribution?
If one tail is longer than another, the distribution is skewed. These distribution are sometimes called asymmetric or asymmertical distributions as they don't show any kind of symmetry. Symmetry means that one half of the distribution is a mirror of the other half. For example, the normal distribution is a symmetric distribution with no skew. The tail are exactly same.

A **left-skewed distribution** has a long left tail. Left-skewed distribution are also called negatively-skewed distributions. That's because there is a long tail in the negative direction on the number line. The mean is also to the left of the peak.

A **right-skewed distribution** has a long right tail. Right-skewed distributions are also called postive-skew distributions. That's because there is a long tail in the postive direction on the number line. The mean is also to the right of the peak.
