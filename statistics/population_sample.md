# Population vs Sample
A `population` data set contains all members of a specified group(the entire list of possible data values). _Example_: The population may be "ALL people living in the US." The numbers we've obtained when using a population are called `parameters`.
s
A `sample` data set contains a part, or a subset of a population. The size of a sample is always less thatn size of the population from which it is taken. Example: The sample may be "SOME people living in the US."

> **Data** - facts and statistics collected to together for reference or analysis.
