**Integrated**- The user doesn't have to reach through the browser, it uses the full capabilities of the device to create an experience true to the device. User experience on the web should feel like an integrated part of the user device; instead of having to reach through a browser window, the experience should feel true to how the user interacts with the device.
- Get a place on the users home screen.
- Simplify payments with the Payment Request API.

**Reliable**- Load instantly and reliably, never showing the downasaur (meaning unable to connect to the internet), even in uncertain network conditions. User don't expect the web to work without a network connect, and often don't even bother to try when it's a slow or intermittent connection. We need to change that perception. The web must be reliable.
- Use the offline cookbook to improve reliability.
- What should you consider when designing for slow or intermittent  networks?

**Engaging**- Keeps the user coming back to the app with beautifully designed experiences that look and feel natural. An engaging app goes beyond functional, but ensures that whole experience is, delightful making it easy for the user to do what they need to do. Using feature like Web Push, it's always up to date, and Notification keeps users informed. It uses the right capabilities, at the right time in a beautiful way.
