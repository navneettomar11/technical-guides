# Array
An array is a collection of items stored at contigous memory location. The idea is to store multipe items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e. the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

## Array Capacity vs Length
> If somebody asks you how long the DVD Array is, what would your answer be?

There are two different answers you might have given
1. The number of DVDs the box could hold, if it was full, or
2. The number of DVDs currently in the box.

Both answers are correct, and both have different meanings! It's important to undertand the difference betweem them, and use them correctly. We call the first one the **capacity** of the Array, and the second one **length** of the Array.
