# What is SOLID principle?
- **S - Single Responsibility principle** - A class should have one and only one reason to change meaning that a class should have only one job.
- **O - Open closed principle** - Object or entities should be open for extension, but close for modification.
- **L - Liskov substitution principle** - Let  q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
- **I - Interface segregation principle** - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or client shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle** - Entities must depend on abstraction not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
