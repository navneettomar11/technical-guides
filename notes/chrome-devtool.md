# Chrome DevTools
Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster.

## Device Mode
Use Device mode to approximate how your page looks and performs on a mobile device.

Device Mode is the name for the loose collection of features in Chrome DevTools that help you simulate mobile devices. These feature include:
- Simulating a mobile viewport
- Throttling the network
- Throttling the CPU
- Simulating geoloction
- Setting orientation

### Limitations
Think of Device Mode as a first-order approximation of how your page looks and feels on a mobile device. With Device Mode you don't actually run your code on a mobile device. You simulate the mobile user experience from your laptop or desktop.
There are some aspects of mobile devices that DevTools will never be able to simulate
